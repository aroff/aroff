# Alexandre ("Alex") Oliveira

- I'm currently focused on deep diving into the implementation of AI agentic tools applied to finance, research, and software engineering.
- I'm looking to collaborate on quantitative research or portfolio management projects that involve hybrid expertise in financial research, software engineering, applied AI, and data management.
- I'm especially interested in the safe application of AI agentic tools to solve financial research and software engineering problems at scale.

## Projects

Some of my lab projects I've been working on:

- **[fastskill](https://github.com/gofastskill/fastskill)** – Package manager for AI agent skills: discovery, install, versioning, and deployment at scale (Claude Code, Cursor compatible).

- **[newton](https://github.com/gonewton/newton)** – CLI for iterative optimization and workflow graphs for agentic AI goals. It is actually mainly used as an orchestrator for AI coding tasks.

- **[ailoop](https://github.com/goailoop/ailoop)** – CLI and server for AI agents to communicate with humans via structured interactions (questions, approvals, notifications; direct and multi-agent server mode).

- **[aikit](https://github.com/goaikit/aikit)** – Universal package manager for AI agent extensions: create, share, and run reusable commands and templates across Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, and more.

- **[reskit](https://github.com/aroff/reskit)** – AI template kit for quantitative investment research: structured workflows, quality gates, and reproducibility for strategy development.

- **[cli-emu](https://github.com/aroff/cli-emulator)** – Deterministic CLI emulator: describe any CLI in YAML and replay it for e2e tests, CI/CD, and agentic workloads without network or real binaries.
